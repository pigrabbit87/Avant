<h3>Avant Programming Practice</h3>
<h4> Factor </h4>
<p> All of the answers to the questions are in the comment sections in the code.</p>
<p> To test the code, run test1() in the main function. Compile the code with c++ 11 </p>
<p> g++ -std=c++11 factor.cpp -o factor </p>
</br>
<h4> Credit Line </h4>
<p> When initilize an instance, one must give the credit limit and the APR in decimal <p>
<p> There are several tests cases in credit_test.rb </p>
<p> The 30 days period is calculated using real time. If one try to check payment it will not be able to because payment period is not up yet </p>
<p> In order to test whether the program is correct, use calculateInterest to find how much interest will be owed instead of using calculatePayment </p>
